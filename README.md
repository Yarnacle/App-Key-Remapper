# App Key Remapper
Popular keymapping software KeyTweak unfortunately is not able to remap Windows app keys (keys that open apps like Calculator or Mail). This Python script was made to remedy this.

## How to Use
1. Input code of app key to be remapped (app key codes can be found [here](#app-key-codes))
2. Choose whether to remap app key to a key input or to a custom script

#### Key input
3. Input new key code to be assigned to app key (regular key codes can be found [here](#https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.keys?view=windowsdesktop-7.0))

#### Custom script
3. Input custom script path
